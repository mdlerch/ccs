In Words
========

Step 0
------

Center and standardize all $x$ and $y$.
Set $\mu = \mathbf{0}$ (i.e. predict $y_i=0$ for all $i$).
Find residuals as $y - \mu$

Step 1
------

Find $x_{j'}$ that is not currently used yet that is most correlated with
residuals, $r = y- \mu$.

Step 2
------

Append to the active set $\mathcal{A}$, $j'$ (from above).  Find the unit vector $u$ that is equiangular with all $x_j$ with $j \in \mathcal{A}$.

Step 3
------

Update $\mu$ to be $\mu = \mu + \gamma u$ with $\gamma$ large enough until a new $j'$ with $x_{j'}$ equally correlated with residuals as $x_j$ with $j \in \mathcal{A}$.

Repeat
------

Repeat 1 through 3 until all variables added: result is OLS.

The vector $u$ is the one such that the dot product of each $x_j$ with $u$ for $j \in \mathcal{A}$ are all equal to the same value.
Let's call that value $A$.
Let's consider $X$ to be the matrix whose columns are the aforementioned $x_j$.
This allows us

TODO: formatting broken

$$ X' u = A \mathbb{ONE} $$

Where $\mathbb{ONE}$ is a vector of 1's.

Now do some intelligent multiplication and note that $H$ is the Hat Matrix and that $Hu = u$ since we want the $u$ that already is in the column space of $X$.
Further, $u'u = 1$ since it is a unit vector.

\begin{align*}
X' u &= A \mathbb{ONE} \\
(X'X)^{-1} X' u &= (X'X)^{-1}A \mathbb{ONE} \\
u'X(X'X)^{-1} X' u &= A\mathbb{ONE}'(X'X)^{-1}A \mathbb{ONE} \\
u'H u &= A\mathbb{ONE}'(X'X)^{-1}A \mathbb{ONE} \\
u'u &= A\mathbb{ONE}'(X'X)^{-1}A \mathbb{ONE} \\
1 &= A^2\mathbb{ONE}'(X'X)^{-1} \mathbb{ONE} \\
A^2 &= (\mathbb{ONE}'(X'X)^{-1}\mathbb{ONE})^{-1} \\
A &= (\mathbb{ONE}'(X'X)^{-1}\mathbb{ONE})^{-1/2} \\
\end{align*}

So, $A$ is solved.
To get $u$, start with $u = Hu$

\begin{align*}
u &= Hu \\
u &= X(X'X)^{-1}X'u \\
u &= X(X'X)^{-1}A\mathbb{ONE} \\
u &= XA(X'X)^{-1}\mathbb{ONE} \\
\end{align*}

The last line is the _typical_ notation.
