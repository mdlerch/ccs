Step 0
======

Center and standardize all $x$ and $y$.
Set $\mu = \mathbf{0}$ (i.e. predict $y_i=0$ for all $i$).
Find residuals as $y - \mu$

Step 1
======

Find $x_{j'}$ that is not currently used yet that is most correlated with
residuals, $r = y- \mu$.

Step 2
======

Append to the active set $\mathcal{A}$, $j'$ (from above).  Find the unit vector $u$ that is equiangular with all $x_j$ with $j \in \mathcal{A}$.

Step 3
======

Update $\mu$ to be $\mu = \mu + \gamma u$ with $\gamma$ large enough until a new $j'$ with $x_{j'}$ equally correlated with residuals as $x_j$ with $j \in \mathcal{A}$.
